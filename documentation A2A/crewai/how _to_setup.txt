1. Install the A2A dependency:
uv add 'crewai[a2a]'
2. Expose agents as A2A servers (for your register):
from crewai import Agent
from crewai.a2a import A2AServerConfig

agent = Agent(
    role="Data Analyst",
    goal="Analyze datasets and provide insights",
    backstory="Expert data scientist with statistical analysis skills",
    llm="gpt-4o",
    a2a=A2AServerConfig(url="https://your-server.com")
)
This auto-generates an agent card at /.well-known/agent-card.json — which is exactly what an A2A register platform would discover.

3. Create client agents that connect to registered agents:
from crewai.a2a import A2AClientConfig

coordinator = Agent(
    role="Research Coordinator",
    goal="Coordinate research tasks efficiently",
    backstory="Expert at delegating to specialized agents",
    llm="gpt-4o",
    a2a=A2AClientConfig(
        endpoint="https://example.com/.well-known/agent-card.json",
        timeout=120,
        max_turns=10
    )
)
4. Agents can be both client AND server:
from crewai.a2a import A2AClientConfig, A2AServerConfig

agent = Agent(
    role="Research Coordinator",
    goal="Coordinate research and serve analysis requests",
    backstory="Expert at delegation and analysis",
    llm="gpt-4o",
    a2a=[
        A2AClientConfig(endpoint="https://specialist.example.com/.well-known/agent-card.json"),
        A2AServerConfig(url="https://your-server.com")
    ]
)
The A2AServerConfig supports customizing skills, capabilities, security schemes, versioning, and more — all useful for a registry platform.
